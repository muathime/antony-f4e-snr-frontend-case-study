# Coding Challenge: Next.js Student Listing and Details Page

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a student listing page using Next.js. The page will display a grid of students' bio data fetched from a mock API and allow users to filter students by grade, age, and gender

## Features
1. Student Grid - Displays students in a grid layout with details such as student image, name, gender, grade, etc. Each student entry includes a "View Details" button.
2. Filterin - Implements multi-based filtering to allow users to view students specific to selected attributes like gender, grade, and age.
3. Responsive Design - Ensures the page layout is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
4. Next.js Integration: Utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side hydration to optimize performance and SEO.
5. API Integration: Fetches mock student data from a JSON API endpoint to populate the student grid.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js: Framework for React-based server-side rendering.
- Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- Material-UI - React UI framework for implementing components and styling.
- TypeScript - Adds static typing to JavaScript for type safety.
